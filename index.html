                    <p>An ambience tuner that allows users to create immersive mixes by blending built-in beats with calming nature sounds. Recommendations in the Discover page are generated using a trained supervised learning ML model in order to match users moods and preferences based on their listening habits. The distraction-free expanded view of the music player includes a timer, with both tools built from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Website targeted for students to learn on the go using flashcards. The ecosystem uses an object-oriented approach of creating labeled flashcard decks called Leafsets, each containing key-value pairs called Leafcards. The website supports making ones Leafsets public and thus visible to other users to save them and practice while also being able to search public Leafsets.</p>

                    <p>A m-by-n Matrix Multiplying subroutine implemented from scratch to be executed on the Motorolla 68000. It takes as a parameter two matrices, each defined in a two-byte addressable memory using row-order, and that return the output matrix stored in memory in row-order. It applies the general matrix multiplication formula consisting of nested loops and summations on a per-element basis using pointers.</p>

                    <p>This Java-based web scraper connects to the BBC News RSS Feed and scans the website, extracts this data as an XML script entity, then runs the Java code that writes the extracted headlines back into a seperate output text file that it creates in the same directory. Once run, the script automatically updates the content in the file with the refreshed current live news headlines, which can be used for further analysis.</p>

                    <p>Motion-sensored LED network controls road lighting by using data from a nighttime sensor and two IR sensors to activate LEDs only when necessary. 555 timer circuits ensures the lights stay on for 90 seconds after a vehicle is detected. It's powered by energy harvested from speed bumps, where mechanical energy is converted into electricity, all regulated by a BQ24650 chip, and stored in lithium batteries.</p>

                    <p>Two sensors inputted to an OR gate made out of MOSFET transistors using HEF4007 IC chip. The first one is for heat, done using a thermistor and a comparator configuration using UA741 OpAmp; the other one is similar but for motion with an LDR instead. Once either sensor is triggered, the gate output voltage would turn on a buzzer, and its amplified current turns on a DC motor whose speed is tuned by a potentiometer.</p>

                    <p>Done using Logic IC chips with brake and gas pedals inputted through pushbuttons and PRND modes encoded after switches. A finite state machine governs the main states and the transitions: park, reverse, neutral and drive with 4 gears. The RPM is handled by a counter designed from scratch and displayed into seven segment displays. LED indicators are used to complement the driver dashboard to show modes and gears.</p>
