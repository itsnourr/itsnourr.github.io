                    <p>A m-by-n Matrix Multiplying subroutine implemented from scratch to be executed on the Motorolla 68000. It takes as a parameter two matrices, each defined in a two-byte addressable memory using row-order, and that return the output matrix stored in memory in row-order. It applies the general matrix multiplication formula consisting of nested loops and summations on a per-element basis using pointers.</p>

                    <p>Two sensors inputted to an OR gate made out of MOSFET transistors using HEF4007 IC chip. The first one is for heat, done using a thermistor and a comparator configuration using UA741 OpAmp; the other one is similar but for motion with an LDR instead. Once either sensor is triggered, the gate output voltage would turn on a buzzer, and its amplified current turns on a DC motor whose speed is tuned by a potentiometer.</p>
