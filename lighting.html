            Motion-sensored LED network controls road lighting by using data from a nighttime sensor and two IR sensors to activate LEDs only when necessary. 555 timer circuits ensures the lights stay on for 90 seconds after a vehicle is detected. It's powered by energy harvested from speed bumps, where mechanical energy is converted into electricity, all regulated by a BQ24650 chip, and stored in lithium batteries.

        <!-- <p class="sneak-desc"> Leafcards welcomes the user with a landing page that provides themed illustrations with eye-catching titles that fully desrcibes the website's features and aims. Upon authentication, users have access to all the Leafsets they created in the <b>My Leafsets</b> page. There they would find a button to create a new leafset and be able to also edit existing ones in a lab-like view. They could also potentially find interesting leafsets created by other users and made public on the <b>Discover Page</b> that includes a search bar to search by label, user or name, a grid of trending leafsets and another of similar ones to the user's. Finally, a <b>Settings</b> dashboard is accessible from the navbar where basic actions where implemented such as password and email change as well as logging out.</p> -->
